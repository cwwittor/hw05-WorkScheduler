Homework 5 for my bootcamp class

Wow, really cut it close again this week. Everything should be functioning from the extensive tests I’ve run through this. Through coding this I had also realized that I probably didn't do this homework through the most conventional means both using a 2d array as well as a large if/else if tree. Overall, the homework was a lot less stressful this week though, I think I had just retained a bit more of this week’s work than last week’s. The homework assignment this week was a planner in which it stores local data along with using the timer API of a website to track what time of day it is for you. I think the point I had struggled with most was honestly trying to get the HTML to work along with the saving of data to local storage. The logic felt like it came fairly easy, although I don’t know if I had used conventional means.
